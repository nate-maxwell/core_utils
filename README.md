# Core Utils

A library of various helpers that are inevitably rewritten in every project.

Specifically written for `windows` development.

### Design Philosophy

A good utility function should exhibit one of the following:

* Meaningfully simplify a common pattern
* Encode non-obvious logic
* Protect against real footguns
* Only wrap existing functions with hard-coded values to enforce standardization
